# Strong_PassWord_Generator
Everybody is really bad at keping the password safe.
Well,one of the most common reasons is password reuse. Using the same password on 20 different sites from Google to Facebook, to Skype, to Spotify,to all the 
random services that we sign up to.
The problem is that when one of these sites get hacked,then the email and password combination you used to signup is compromised.
Check Your Email if it has been pwned!!

But if you want better security,then you'll actually need unique passwords for each and every website.And they should really be strong passwords, not 123456, or qwerty.
